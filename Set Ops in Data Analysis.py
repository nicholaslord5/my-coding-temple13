# The aim of this assignment is to enhance your skills in using Python sets for data analysis tasks. 
# You will apply various set operations to handle real-world data scenarios, focusing on 
# their practical application and efficiency.

# Task 1: Duplicate Entries Cleanup You are given a list of customer IDs, 
# some of which are duplicated. 
# Write a Python script to remove duplicates and display the unique customer IDs.

# Example Code:

# customer_ids = ["C001", "C002", "C003", "C002", "C001", "C004"]
# Expected Outcome: A set of unique customer IDs, ensuring no duplicates. 
# For instance, `{'C001', 'C002', 'C003', 'C004'}`. ---

customer_ids = ["C001", "C002", "C003", "C002", "C001", "C004"]

unique_customer_ids = set(customer_ids)
print("Unique Custome IDs:", unique_customer_ids)
